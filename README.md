# Day-Planner

## User Story

My task for this homework is to create a day planner that is interactive and saves the data so it stays if you refresh.  The color of the times change based on the time of day.

## My Task

My task is to create a daily planner for my client.  This will let you save events per hour and the hours are shown if they are present past or future hours based on the color.

## Acceptance Citeria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
